# Genomic-Interpreter-Transformer
Attention-based hierarchical Transformer (1D-Swin) for DNA sequence analysis. 
This project implements a **1D Swin Transformer**, a variation of the original [Swin Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030) architecture adapted for 1D input data such as time-series, sensor signals, or sequence modeling tasks.
